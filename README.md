# TMDB-Movie-Revenue-Prediction

With the gradual popularity of the film industry, film directors and producers invest an increasing amount of money on movie production and later advertising promotion. Given that major films costing over $100 million to produce can still flop, how to predict the success of a movie before it is released is more important than ever to the industry. Can we predict which films will be highly rated, or earn high revenue? Can we find some consistent formulas to recommend to filmmakers to ensure commercial success after the release? These are the main problems we want to solve in our project.

By doing this project, multiple machine learning models (CART, Random Forest, Boosting Regression) can be built to accurately predict the box office revenue, which greatly informs the tough investment decision-making process when facing such a highrisk and high-yield opportunity in the film market. In addition, our prediction is highly important for advertisement companies that seek to embed their ads in popular movies. By mastering the key formula for film success, we can help film producers produce films that cater to the market and capital. Our prediction can also assist cinemas in scheduling movies and help people choose movies to watch.
